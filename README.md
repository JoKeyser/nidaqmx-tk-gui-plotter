# nidaqmx-tk-gui-plotter

A simple GUI to use NI-DAQmx and plot data in real time, in Python and Tk

## Purpose

Showcase the use of NI-DAQmx in Python by plotting recorded data in real time.

## Design

The code aims to be as simple and extensible as possible, to enable learning and modification.
Make it as Pythonic and as efficient as possible, but readability is more important.
Default values are only changed when necessary.

Dependencies are limited to the essential libraries.
Only the most recent versions are supported.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create minimal example of using NI-DAQmx in Python.
- [ ] Create minimal example of plotting the data in real time.
- [ ] Create a TKinter GUI to control the data acquisition and plotting.

## Installation

Install Python 3 and the necessary modules, see <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>.

You also need the following Python modules:

- `nidaqmx` to use NI-DAQmx, see [nidaqmx](https://nidaqmx-python.readthedocs.io/)
- `numpy` to handle arrays, see [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- `matplotlib` to plot data, see [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- `tkinter` to create the GUI, see [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
